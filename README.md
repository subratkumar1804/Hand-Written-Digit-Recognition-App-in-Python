# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition-App-in-Python

The code detects handwritten digits and recognizes them Using OpenCV and Tensorflow Python module.

The project detects and recognizes  handwritten digits in a given image using OpenCV and Tensorflow Python module.

Firstly we will load the dataset. Here the mnist dataset of keras.datasets is used.

 

The data is stored as follows:

1. train  

2. test 

The dataset consists of handwritten digits and the labels consist of their numerical value.

This project is implemented on Jupyter notebook of Anaconda. The values for digit detection using openCV depends on the input image.

The Python libraries used are :

1. NumPy

3. Tensorflow

4. OpenCV
